# Intro

In this case we will be working with the **Ames Housing Dataset** from today's kaggle challenge. We already used different `Learner`s on it and tried to optimize their hyperparameters. Today we will

- preprocess the data as an integrated step of the model fitting process
- tune the preprocessing parameters
- use multiple `Learners` in as an *ensemble* model

# Prerequisites

We expect you have installed all packages from day 1. If not, load the day 1 script and run the **Prerequisites** install chunk.

Additional packages needed:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("mlr3filters", "visNetwork"))
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3pipelines")
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3learners")
```

Load the packages we are going to use:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("data.table")
library("magrittr")
library("mlr3")
library("mlr3learners")
library("ggplot2")
theme_set(theme_light())
library("mlr3tuning")
future::plan("multiprocess")
```

# Intro

In this tutorial we will take a look at composite machine learning algorithms that may incorporate data preprocessing or the combination of multiple `Learner`s ("ensemble methods").

The package we use is **mlr3pipelines**, which enables us to chain "`PipeOp`" objects into data flow graphs. Load the package using
```{r}
library("mlr3pipelines")
```

We will start with a simple example and then go on to work on the Kaggle dataset we have seen the past two days. Get it at https://www.kaggle.com/c/ames-day3/data and save the datasets in the `data/` directory.

# Preprocessing

- Real world data often has properties that many Learners can not handle natively
  - missing values
  - categorical features
    - possibly with high cardinality
  - multicollinearity
    - an important instance of that: almost constant features
- Sometimes data needs to be transformed to make the available signal more compatible with the Learner and remove irrelevant noise ("feature extraction")
  - remove irrelevant features ("feature extraction")
  - add feature interactions

## Ames Housing Data

- As said before, you should have the ames data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ames-day3/data saved in the `data/` directory.
- Note the `read.csv` call we use: both empty strings and 'NA' strings indicate missing values.
- Lets load the data and construct a `Task`

```{r}
setwd("/home/troywhorten/intro_ds/day3")
train_set = read.csv("data/ames_housing_train_original.csv", na.string = c("", "NA"))
task = TaskRegr$new(id = "ames_housing", backend = train_set, target = "SalePrice")
```
- We instantiate a resampling instance for this task to be able to compare resampling performance.
```{r}
set.seed(8008135)
cv10_instance = rsmp("cv")$instantiate(task)
```
- Because the data is not very well behaved at all, we are going to make a smaller task in the beginning to try some things.
```{r}
small_task = task$clone()$select(c("Garage.Yr.Blt", "Lot.Frontage", "Bsmt.Exposure", "Yr.Sold"))
```

## Building an Imputation Pipeline

- We notice we have lots of "missing" data here. The `Task` object reports these with the `$missings()` function.
```{r}
small_task$missings()
```
- -> First we do *imputation*
- There are a few imputation `PipeOp`s
```{r}
mlr_pipeops$keys("impute")
```
- We will do median imputation for numeric features. What does it look like?
- Note we have to put the `Task` in a `list()` to train a `PipeOp`.
```{r}
imputed = po("imputemedian")$train(list(small_task))[[1]]
imputed$missings()
```
- It did not touch the factorial features!
- For factorial features, we will add a new level `.MISSING`
- We create a `Graph` from the two `PipeOp`s, they work one after the other.
```{r}
imputer = po("imputemedian") %>>% po("imputenewlvl")
imputer$plot(html = T)
```
```{r}
imputed = imputer$train(small_task)[[1]]
imputed$missings()
```

- Compare the levels of a random feature with the original task:
```{r}
small_task$levels("Bsmt.Exposure")

imputed$levels("Bsmt.Exposure")
```

- Let's see how this works with a very simple learner, `regr.lm`.
```{r}
limo = lrn("regr.lm")
```

- Compare the original task: Gives an error
```{r, error = TRUE}
resample(small_task, limo, cv10_instance)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
- With the imputer, should work
```{r}
resample(small_task, imputer %>>% limo, cv10_instance)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```

- The `Learner` would not know know which data was imputed
- We add "missing indicator" columns
- `po("missind")` is used for this, *but* it removes all original columns!
```{r}
po("missind")$train(list(small_task))[[1]]
```
- We need to calculate in parallel!
```
             ----------
[INPUT] -+-->| impute |--------,
         |   ----------        |
         |                     V
         |   -----------   -----------
         `-->| missind |-->| Feature |--> [OUTPUT]
             -----------   |  Union  |
                           -----------
```

- For this we need the "upper" lane: we have it already, `imputer`
- The lower lane is just `po("missind")`
- We combine everything in `po("featureunion")`

```{r}
impandmiss = gunion(list(imputer, po("missind"))) %>>% po("featureunion")

impandmiss$plot(html = TRUE)
```

```{r}
impandmiss$train(small_task)[[1]]
```
- When training this the result contains both the imputed features, and also the missing indicator columns
- There are *too many* missing indicator columns: `"Bsmt.Exposure"` is a factorial column, so the `.MISSING` level already shows there is missing data--`"missing_Bsmt.Exposure"` is superfluous
- We therefore prepend `missind` with the `"select"` `PipeOp` that filters out all the non-integer columns.
```{r}
impandmiss = gunion(list(imputer, po("select", selector = selector_type("integer")) %>>% po("missind"))) %>>% po("featureunion")

impandmiss$plot(html = TRUE)
```

```{r}
impandmiss$train(small_task)[[1]]
```
```{r}
impandmiss$train(small_task)[[1]]$head(8)
```

```{r}
resample(small_task, impandmiss %>>% limo, cv10_instance)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
- This gives us a smaller MAE, possibly the learner is making use of the information that a value was actually imputed.

## Making Models more robust

- If we try this pipelne with the full `Task`, we run into trouble: Our model doesn't know how to handle new factor levels during prediction.
```{r, error = TRUE}
resample(task, impandmiss %>>% limo, cv10_instance)
```

- Problem: Test set contains levels that were not seen during training, which the `Learner` can not handle
- We use another `PipeOp`, `"fixfactors"`, that makes sure no new levels are introduced:
  - It remembers during training what factor levels were seen
  - It converts unseen factor levels during prediction to `NA` values.
- These `NA` values we have to impute *again*, but not with the `.MISSING` imputer---it could add new levels again!
- Instead we use the `"imputesample"` imputer: it samples randomly from the training set.
- We also add the `"removeconstants"` pipeop, because it is possible that a training split only contains a single level, which could break learners.
```{r}
robustify = po("fixfactors") %>>% po("imputesample") %>>% po("removeconstants")
robustimp = impandmiss %>>% robustify
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
svm = lrn("regr.svm")
numsel = po("select", id = "blerg", selector = selector_type("integer"))
resample(task, robustimp %>>% numsel %>>% svm, cv10_instance)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
- Taking into account more features sure pays off!
- But we get a warning about rank deficient matrix, we should try a model that can handle large numbers of features

```{r}
resample(task, robustimp %>>% lrn("regr.ranger"), cv10_instance)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```

## Collapsing Factors and Tuning

- We can use the `"collapsefactors"` `PipeOp` to remove very infrequent factors.
- How many should we collapse? Let's find out by tuning.
```{r}
collapsinglrn = GraphLearner$new(robustimp %>>% po("collapsefactors") %>>% lrn("regr.lm"))
```
- We look at the `ParamSet` to see which parameter we can tune. There are a lot! Each parameter is named after the `PipeOp` it belongs to.
```{r}
collapsinglrn$param_set
```
- We optimize the `collapsefactors.target_level_count` parameter.
```{r}
library("paradox")
searchspace = ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamDbl$new("log_collapsefactors.target_level_count", lower = log(2), upper = log(100))
))
searchspace$trafo = function(x, param_set) {
  list(collapsefactors.target_level_count = round(exp(x$log_collapsefactors.target_level_count)))
}
```
- Because this is only one parameter, we will use grid search. For higher dimensions, random search is more appropriate.
```{r}
inst = TuningInstance$new(
  task, collapsinglrn, cv10_instance, msr("regr.mae"),
  searchspace, term("none")
)
tuner = tnr("grid_search", resolution = 10)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
tuner$tune(inst)
```
```{r}
arx = inst$archive("tune_x")
ggplot(arx, aes(x = log_collapsefactors.target_level_count, y = regr.mae)) + geom_line()
```

- Ultimately this does not appear to be very successful
```{r}
inst$result
```

# Other Preprocessing Ideas

## Feature Selection

- A common use case for preprocessing is feature filtering
- `mlr3pipelines` makes use of the `mlr3filters` package
```{r}
library("mlr3filters")
mlr_filters
```
- We try the `correlation` filter. For clarity we will also drop all non-integer features
```{r}
fltgraph = robustimp %>>% po("select", id = "selector2", selector = selector_type("integer")) %>>%
  po("filter", flt("correlation"), filter.nfeat = 10)

fltgraph$plot(html = TRUE)
```
```{r}
fltgraph$train(task)[[1]]$data()
```

- The performance is not stellar, but having few features is helpful when trying to interpret the model
```{r}
rr = resample(task, fltgraph %>>% limo, cv10_instance, store_model = TRUE)
rr$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
```{r}
summary(rr$learners[[1]]$model$regr.lm$model)
```

## PCA

A popular preprocessing method for feature extraction is principal component analysis
- We use the `"pca"` `PipeOp` and take the first 20 principal components
- Again just from the numerical features

```{r}
pcagraph = robustimp %>>% po("select", id = "selector2", selector = selector_type("integer")) %>>%
  po("pca", rank. = 20)
```
```{r}
rr = resample(task, pcagraph %>>% limo, cv10_instance, store_model = TRUE)
rr$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
```{r}
summary(rr$learners[[1]]$model$regr.lm$model)
```

# Multiple Learners

## Mean Aggregation

- Use multiple learners, aggregate their mean prediction
- May give better results if individual learners predict well on average with high variance
```{r}
meangraph = robustimp %>>% list(lrn("regr.lm"), lrn("regr.ranger"), lrn("regr.kknn")) %>>% po("regravg")

meangraph$plot(html = TRUE)
```
```{r, warning = FALSE}
rr = resample(task, meangraph, cv10_instance, store_model = TRUE)
rr$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```

## Stacking

- Instead of just mean-aggregating predictions, we build a model on the predictions of learners
- This needs the `"learner_cv"` PipeOp, because predictions need to be available during training already
  - the `"learner_cv"` PipeOp performs crossvalidation during the training phase and emits the cross validated predictions.
```{r}
stackgraph = robustimp %>>%
  list(po("learner_cv", id = "stack_lm", robustify %>>% lrn("regr.lm")),
    po("learner_cv", lrn("regr.ranger")),
    po("learner_cv", lrn("regr.kknn"))) %>>%
  po("featureunion", id = "fu2") %>>% lrn("regr.lm")

stackgraph$plot(html = TRUE)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
rr = resample(task, stackgraph, cv10_instance, store_model = TRUE)
rr$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```

# Your Ideas!

- Try different methods for preprocessing and training
- Some hints:
  - It is not allowed to have two `PipeOp`s with the same `ID` in a `Graph`. Initialize a `PipeOp` with `po("...", id = "xyz")` to change its ID on construction
  - Don't build too large `Graph`s involving complicated optimizations, like too many `"learner_cv"`--they need a long time to train
  - Use the `affect_columns` parameter if you want a `PipeOp` to only operate on part of the data. Use `po("select")` if you want to remove certain columns (possibly only along a single branch of multiple parallel branches). Both take `selector_XXX()` arguments, e.g. `selector_type("integer")`
  - You may get the best performance if you actually inspect the features and see what kind of transformations work best for them.
  - See what `PipeOp`s are available by inspecting `mlr_pipeops$keys()`, and get help about them using `?mlr_pipeops_XXX`.

# Demo Submission

- How we constructed our stacking model
```{r, warning = FALSE}
imputer = po("imputemedian") %>>% po("imputenewlvl")

impandmiss = gunion(list(imputer, po("select", selector = selector_type("integer")) %>>%
  po("missind"))) %>>%
  po("featureunion")

robustify = po("fixfactors") %>>% po("imputesample") %>>% po("removeconstants")
robustimp = impandmiss %>>% robustify

svm <- lrn("regr.svm")
numsel <- po("select", id = "blerg", selector = selector_type("integer"))
svmpipe <- robustify %>>% numsel %>>% svm

stackgraph <- robustimp %>>%
  list(po("learner_cv", id = "stack_lm", robustify %>>% lrn("regr.lm")),
    po("learner_cv", lrn("regr.ranger")),
    po("learner_cv", lrn("regr.kknn")),
    po("learner_cv", id = "svm_pipe", svmpipe)) %>>%
  po("featureunion", id = "fu2") %>>% lrn("regr.lm")

resample(task, stackgraph, cv10_instance, store_model = TRUE)$aggregate(msr("regr.mae"))
```
- Training it on the whole dataset and creating a prediction submission
```{r, warning = FALSE}
test_set = read.csv("data/ames_housing_test_original.csv")

final_learner = GraphLearner$new(stackgraph)$train(task)

pred = final_learner$predict_newdata(task, test_set)
pred = as.data.table(pred)
pred$truth = NULL
write.csv(pred, "data/ames_housing_submission_day3.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
